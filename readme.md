CRM Launcher provides an easy yet powerful way to implement social media based customer service right in your very own (new or existing) website. You can choose to link Twitter and/or Facebook to CRM Launcher.

Everytime someone Tweets you or sends you a Facebook message, a "case" is created for that person. CRM Launcher provides a gorgeous overview of all cases you have.

## Documentation
